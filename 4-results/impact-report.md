# UAT System Migration Impact Report

## Summary of Impact:

As directly **managed and led User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** efforts across **5 countries**, I oversaw the successful testing and validation of financial data, ensuring that all systems were accurate post-migration. Below is a summary of the impact:

### Key Achievements:
- Successfully managed and led UAT efforts for **5 key countries** in the APAC region, ensuring **100% accuracy** by validating financial data across **over 80 financial reports**.
- Achieved **timely data migration and testing**, facilitating smooth financial operations post-migration.
- Recognized by **global finance leadership** for **exceptional attention to detail** and **problem-solving skills** during the critical system migration.
- Received positive feedback from regional, local teams on the **effectiveness of training and support provided**.

### Lessons Learned:

Throughout this global financial system migration project, here are several key insights that I have gained:

1. **Governance and Compliance:** Implement robust governance frameworks to ensure adherence to financial regulations and internal policies.
   
2. **Scalability and Performance:** Conducting performance test with realistic data volumes, complexity of the production environment and concurrent users, ensuring OneStream XF can handle large datasets and high transaction volumes typical of Fortune 500 companies.

3. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of all UAT activities, findings, and resolutions to support auditing and future reference.
  
4. **Iterative Testing:** Conduct multiple UAT cycles if necessary, detailed cutover planning and dry runs allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of the system before Go-Live.

5. **Cross-Regional Collaboration:** Regular cross-regional by implement a weekly call to share insights and address common challenges sync-ups facilitated the sharing of best practices and common issue resolutions.
  
6. **Post-Implementation Support Strategy:** Establishing a robust post-go-live support structure during UAT ensured a smoother transition to business-as-usual operations.

7. **End-User Involvement:** Involving end-users in UAT improved system adoption and provided valuable insights into user experience issues.

These lessons learned have been instrumental in refining our approach to large-scale, global UAT projects, leading to more efficient processes, higher quality outcomes, and improved stakeholder satisfaction.
